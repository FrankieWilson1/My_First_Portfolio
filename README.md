## About This Repository

This repository contains a series of tasks designed to reinforce my understanding of HTML. Each task focuses on specific HTML concepts and includes my solutions, which can serve as examples for others learning HTML.

## Tasks Overview

Here is a summarized list of the tasks included in this repository:

- **Task 0**: **Basic Structure**
  - Create a valid HTML file named `base_index.html` with a `DOCTYPE`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.

    - An embedded tweet
    - Links back to `index.html` and vice versa.
